          <p> Here at MeToo, we believe that a community thrives only as much as its people.</p>
          <p> Harvard University released troubling statistics earlier this year. 1 in 5 women and 1 in 16 men are sexually assaulted while in college. Sexual assaults are the most underreported crime in the US. And most assaults are perputrated by a small number of individuals, and are much more common the first 3 months of the year. We wanted to turn the tables and put information back in the hands of Harvard students. MeToo is an app that allows people to anonymously post information about assaults on a map and other students can search the information so they can make the best informed decisions as they go about their daily lives. </p>
